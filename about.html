            <h2>Curiosity, made concrete</h2>
            <p>
              I’m someone who enjoys turning vague curiosity into something concrete —
              a structure, a model, or a decision that makes sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m not driven by titles. I’m driven by questions that don’t yet have a clear answer.
            </p>

          <section class="block">
            <h2>How I think</h2>
            <p>
              I like breaking complex problems into smaller, explainable pieces. Whether it’s data,
              systems, or people, I care about understanding <em>why</em> something works before deciding
              <em>how</em> to act.
            </p>
            <p>
              Analytics, to me, is not about fancy models or dashboards. It’s a language — a way to clarify
              assumptions, connect evidence to decisions, and move ideas forward with confidence.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="block">
            <h2>What I’ve done</h2>
            <p>
              My background spans business analytics, finance, and operations. I’ve worked across market research,
              financial analysis, e-commerce operations, and marketing support — and I enjoy translating data into
              insights that are practical, communicable, and grounded in real-world context.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond analytics, I care deeply about communication and people. As a PASS Leader and HR Chair at UBC,
              I’ve designed learning experiences, supported large student cohorts, led cross-functional teams,
              and helped ideas reach wider audiences through thoughtful storytelling and collaboration.
            </p>

          <section class="block">
            <h2>Where I’m going</h2>
            <p>
              I’m currently exploring roles at the intersection of analytics, decision-making, and creative problem
              solving — where structure meets intuition, and curiosity leads to action.
            </p>
            <p class="closing">
              This space is a small window into how I think and work. If you’re curious too, welcome.
