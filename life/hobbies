                    <p>Mountains stand, waters run.</p>
                    <p>In 2024 I climbed Abuji Tso in Yunnan, China, at an altitude of 4,400 metres. This was my second high altitude trek. In the future, I will continue to challenge myself and my next goal is Haba Snow Mountain at 5300 metres.</p>

                    <h3>🌍 Road Trip 🚗</h3>
                    <p>Wander where the wind blows.</p>
                    <p>In 2024, my total road trip mileage was about 15,000 kilometres. I travelled the west coast of the US (Vancouver-San Francisco-Los Angeles-San Diego-Las Vegas-Vancouver). In addition, I drove about 4,000 kilometres in Yunnan, China in order to taste different Pu'er teas. I have some other short trips (within 1000km). in 2025, my goal is to drive to Tuktoyaktuk in the north of Canada, in the middle of the Arctic Circle. I also plan to drive the middle of the USA.</p>
                    <p>2025 end. This year I changed my plan but Tuktoyaktuk is still my dream. It is such a busy year. My graduate program is too busy! In my I went back to west of US from San Francisco to Las Vegas then turn north to Yellowstone National Park. I visited 9 national parks and Salt Lake City. In the next half year. Driving the Tang Poetry Road from Hangzhou to Wenzhou, I found myself inside Li Bai’s line—“天姥连天向天横，势拔五岳掩赤城.” Some landscapes are not meant to be seen, but to be understood.</p>
                    <p>2026 is in progress...</p>

                    <p>Writing to save myself.</p>
                    <p>I have written more than a dozen poems, and I am best at writing FIVE CHARACTER QUATRAINS. my favourite poet is Bai Juyi, and you can talk to me about writing poems, or Shengtang poets.</p>
                    <p>This year（2025), I wrote a Chinese Poem when I went to 24 road Utah, US to describe the “space needle” view I saw. I hope you like it.</p>

                    <p>Grip and go.</p>
                    <p>Normally, I go up to the mountains for off-roading, and the place I go to most often is Stave Lake on the east side of Vancouver, which is one of the most popular off-roading spots in Vancouver in the spring or winter.</p>
                    <p>2026, this year, I sold my off-road vehicle because I graduated and need to go back to China. I am sad.
