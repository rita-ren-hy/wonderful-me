          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Joined an early-stage feminine hygiene and personal care brand operating on Taobao and Douyin.
            The work was centered on making product and growth decisions with clearer evidence, not guesswork.
          </p>

          <h2>What I worked on</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Market & competitor teardown:</strong>
              Benchmarked top brands/SKUs across major e-commerce platforms, breaking down value propositions,
              PDP structure, and bundle design to identify what could be replicated and where differentiation made sense.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customer & pricing insights:</strong>
              Used user survey data to segment customers by usage scenarios, price sensitivity, and purchase drivers,
              supporting a mid-to-low pricing direction and a core-customer focus aligned with the brand’s plant-based positioning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Growth & conversion support:</strong>
              Synthesized industry trends and social media content performance to propose content-led and review-driven
              influencer strategies, contributing to ~15% improvement in conversion and customer satisfaction (as reported internally).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How to turn a fuzzy business question (“what should we emphasize?”) into a repeatable workflow:
              competitor structure → customer segmentation → positioning & pricing → content execution.
            </li>
            <li>
              That analysis only creates value when it is packaged into actions:
              clear options, trade-offs, and recommendations that a team can execute quickly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Tools</h2>
          <p>Excel · Desk research · Survey analysis · E-commerce platform observation</p>

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Worked within the accounting function supporting financial data management and internal analysis,
            helping improve comparability across subsidiaries and strengthening audit readiness.
          </p>

          <h2>What I worked on</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Financial analysis & benchmarking:</strong>
              Analyzed internal financial data and supported cross-subsidiary comparisons on costs, expenses,
              and operating metrics to identify material variances and potential risk areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decision support through standardization:</strong>
              Assisted in building a more consistent reporting framework and analytical methodology so results were
              comparable across teams and time periods.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data & compliance support:</strong>
              Maintained accounting records using Excel and financial systems, helping organize vouchers/archives and
              supporting centralized data management for better traceability and audit compliance.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Why “one source of truth” matters: when definitions and reporting logic are standardized,
              benchmarking becomes more reliable and variance analysis becomes actionable.
            </li>
            <li>
              How to communicate finance insights in a decision-friendly way:
              not only what changed, but what to look at next (drivers, structure vs. one-off, potential risk signals).
            </li>
          </ul>
